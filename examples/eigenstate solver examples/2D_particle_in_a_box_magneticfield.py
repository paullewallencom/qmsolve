# This example computes the eigenstates of a charged particle in a magnetic field Bz, that points in the z direction.
#
# Notes:
# The example requires to use potential_type = "matrix" in the Hamiltonian constructor, 
# which allows to use momentum operators (px and py) in the potential term
# particle.x, particle.px , particle.y, particle.py, are treated as operators, and they are discretized as matrices. Therefore, for multiplying them,
# we use the @ instead of *, because this is the operator that represents matrix multiplication.
